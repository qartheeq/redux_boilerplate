# How to use

1. Download the project folder. 

    NOTE: Currently the project has grown in size a bit (roughly 45MB) because of .git folder size (this is probably because I had to upload different versions of the .gif file throughout time). If you want
 a version of the project which is smaller in size (16 MB), use following commmand for downloading: ```git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/giorgi-m/online-shop.git```

2. ```cd``` into the project folder.
3. ```npm install```
4. ```npm start```
